# $purify utility

`$purify` is the twin utility of `stringify`. In JavaScript, any object passed via template literals will turn to `[Object object]`. To avoid that from happening, `$render` introduces `stringify` to convert data to a string before passing it to template literals.

By default, `$render` use `$purify` internally on any props passed to a component or any utilities so you don't need to do it yourself. The only time you need `$purify` is when you don't use `$render` component and internal utilities.

That means you need to `$purify` a `stringified` data passed to a function.

```js copy
 const App = () => {
  const media = {};
  return `
    <div id="main">
      <article>
          <Player />
          <Playlist />
          <Overlay />
      </article>
      <button onClick="transformMedia(${media})">transform media</button>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

In this case, you need to use `$purify` to convert the argument received to JavaScript equivalent because it doesn't pass through $render component or internal utilities.

* You can't use $purify here


```js copy
function Calculator(){
  const operands = {first:4, second:5};
  return`
    <button 
      onClick="$trigger(${add}, '${stringify(operands)}')">
      add
    </button>
  `;
}
```

You don't need to purify operands in `add` utility as everything passes through an internal utility `$trigger`.

In short, you use `$purify` when you stringify data that doesn't pass through `$render`.
