# $select utility

$select is a unified utility to access the DOM. It accesses single and multiple elements accessible with JavaScript. $select returns an `array` of elements. It supports all `CSS selectors`.

It's like `import` for DOM.

### Selecting an element

To select an element, you need to destructure the `return value of $select` because it is an array.

```js copy
const [audio] = $select('#audio');
console.log(audio);
```

### Selecting grouped elements

Elements selected with `class`, `tag` and other group `selectors` are grouped into one -- an array.

```js copy
const posts = $select('.post');
posts.map(post => console.log(post));
```

### Select single and grouped elements

```js copy
const [audio, posts, comments] = $select('#audio, .post, .comment');

console.log(audio);

posts.map(post => console.log(post));

comments.map(comment => console.log(comment));
```

### A complex selection

```js copy
const [
    posts,
    comments,
    audios,
    features
    articles,
    navs
] = $select('posts, comments, .audios, #features>.feature, [article], .nav');
```

`$select` is a simple and unified utility to access the DOM.
