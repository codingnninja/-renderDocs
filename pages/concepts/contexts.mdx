# Contexts

A context is a point of operations or availabilities, that is, a place or area where some operations take place. Some call it execution context.

If an operation opens or an identifier is accessible within a component, then it is the context of that component.

```js filename="list.js" {2} copy
const List = () => {
  const list = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 24
  };
  return `<Person id="list"> ${list.name} />`;
}
```

The `list` variable and the `Person` component are in the context of the `List` component because they open or only accessible within the `List` component.
