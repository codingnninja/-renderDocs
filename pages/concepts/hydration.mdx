# Hydration

Hydration is the process of attaching event handlers to `html` on the client side but in $render, `Hydration` works by default in the browser so there is no need to take some extra time to `re-compile`. What you write is what you get in the browser.

When you wrap a function with template literals while passing it to an event handler in a component, it is hydrated into the component.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: It is recommended to create any utility with a native function.
</Callout>

```js copy
function add(props) {
  const result = props.first + props.second;
  $render(Calculator, result);
}

function Calculator(result) {
  return `
    <div id="calc">
      ${result ? `updated to ${result}` : ""}
      <button 
        onClick="$trigger(${add}, null, {first:4, second:5})">
        add
      </button>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

The browser will hydrate the `add` function above into the `Calculator` component. It attaches the function to the element returned by the `Calculator` component.

```js copy
<button 
  onClick="$trigger(function add(props){
  return props.first + props.second;
}, {first:4, second:5})">
  add
</button>
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: You don't need to wrap a function in template literals (`${toggle}`) while working with a script tags because all functions are accessible in a `script` tag by default. You only need it in esModules.
</Callout>

### Avoiding hydrations from template literals

Maybe you don't like how hydrated functions look in the browser, you can avoid hydration by passing `functions` to components as `props` or use the `$utils()` method provided by $render to use `function` utilities in the components.
