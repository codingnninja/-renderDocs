# Props

Props are the data/properties passed to a component as its attributes.

```js {2} copy
return `
  <Audio id="audio" song=${stringify(song)} />
`;
```

`song` is a prop because it is passed to the `Audio` component as one of its attributes. 

### Passing down and using a prop

* Passing down a prop

```js {2} copy
return `
  <Audio song=${stringify(song)} />
`;
```

* Using a prop

```js copy
  function Audio(song){
    return`
      <div id="audio">
        <audio src="${song.url}"></audio>
      </div>
    `;
  }
```

### Passing down and using props

* Passing down props

```js {3,4} copy
return `
  <Audio 
    song=${stringify(song)}
    autoplaySong=${autoplaySong}
  />
`;
```

* Using props

```js {4,5} copy
  function Audio({song, autoplaySong}){
    return`
      <div id="audio">
        <audio src="${song.url}"></audio>
        <button onClick="autoplaySong(song)">Play song</button>
      </div>
    `;
  }
```

Yeah! That is how to pass down and use single and multiple props in `$render`.
