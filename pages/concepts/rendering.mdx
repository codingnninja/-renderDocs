# Rendering

Rendering refers to the process of displaying or updating the user interface of a web application. $render uses `$render(Component, props)` utility to achieve React like rendering without virtual DOM.

Rendering and re-rendering often change the state of elements in a component.[Learn more](https://render-docs.vercel.app/utils/$render).

### Conditional rendering

In $render, you can render your components based on some conditions using `if`, `&&` and `?:` operators.

### Direct rendering
