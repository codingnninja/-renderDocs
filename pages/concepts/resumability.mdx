# Resumability

It is the ability of a component to change (stop, pause or continue) initiated operations without the need to hydrate and re-render. Imagine an `Audio` component playing a song. If you pause the song, instead of the component to re-render, it will trigger the audio element to stop or resume when necessary.

That is resumability in the context of $render. 

$select and $trigger utilities make it possible to change operations of any elements in a $render component without re-rendering and hydration like in React.
