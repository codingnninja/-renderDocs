# Resumability

It is the ability of a component to stop, pause or continue initiated operations without the need to re-render. Imagine an `Audio` component playing a song. If you pause the song, instead of the component to re-render, it will trigger the audio element to stop or resume when necessary.

That is resumability in the context of $render. 

$select and $trigger utilities make it possible to stop, pause or resume operations of any elements in a $render component without re-rendering and hydration like in React.
