# State

State is current data which is liable to change based on predefined or user interactions. In `$render`, state is declared with a normal JavaScript variable with an assigned value. There are two kinds of state -- unit and composite state.

### Unit state

It is a state that represent a property of an entity (an app, a module, a  class, a function or a component).

```js
const color = 'blue';
```

### Composite state

It is a state declaration to represent every property of an entity (an object, an app or a component). An object is used for a composite state in Javascript to contain all properties needed in the component.

```js
const person = {
    name: 'Doe',
    age: 89,
    nationality: 'German'
    address: { city: 'New York'}
}
```

State can be viewed in two context in $render -- app and component contexts.

### State in a local component context

A component state is the current or latest data of the component. Components in `$render` can use unit and composite state.

* Unit state in a `$render` component

Unit state is used in a component when a component has only one view property.

```js copy {1}
const Count = (count = 0) {
  //component body 
}
```

You can declare your state in unit like above.

It suitable when you only need to pass one property around for re-rendering.

* Composite state in a `$render` component

Composite state is used in a component when a component has many view properties.

```js {1}
const MovingDot = (coordinates = { x:0, y:3 }) {
 // code
}
```

`or`

```js {1}
const MovingDot = ({ x=0, y=3 } = {}) {
 // code
}
```

Composite state is suitable when you have to pass many properties around for re-rendering.

### State in the global scope

A global state is the current or latest data of an app that is accessible to all parts of the app. A global state can be used from anywhere in an application. 

In `$render`, you can use `$state()` in any component to access the state of you application. [Learn more](https://render-docs.vercel.app/other_utilities/$state()).

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

  Note: always make sure anything accessible to the `$state()` utility is needed by most parts of your application if not all parts.
</Callout>

### Global component context.

It is state of a component stored in a global state but only accessible by the component and any component that subscribes to the context. 

In $render, you can use `$createContext() and $useContext()` in any component to create and access `a global component context`. [Learn more](https://render-docs.vercel.app/other_utilities/$render_context/#createContext()) 

In short, the global component context is like the React context but with a twist.

State is created within a component or global scope and it can be passed down to children components as `props`, in short, for properties.
