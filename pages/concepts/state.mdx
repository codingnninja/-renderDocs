# State

State is current data which is liable to change based on predefined or user interactions. In $render, state is declared with a normal JavaScript variable with an assigned value. There are two kind of state -- unit and composite state.

### Unit state

It is a state that represent a property of a component.

```js
const color = 'blue';
```

### Composite state

It is a state declaration to represent every property of an entity (an object, an app or a component. An object is used for a composite state in Javascript to contain all properties needed in the component.

```js
const person = {
    name: 'Doe',
    age: 89,
    nationality: 'German'
    address: { city: 'New York'}
}
```

State can be viewed in two context in $render -- app and component context.

### State in a local component context

A component state is the current or latest data of the component. Components in $render can use unit and composite state.

* Unit state in a $render component

Unit state is used in a component when a component has only one view property.

```js copy {1}
const Count = (count = 0) {
  //component body 
}
```

`or`

```js copy {1}
const Count = (prop) {
  const count = prop || 0;

}
```

You can declare your state in unit like above.

It suitable when you only need to pass one or few properties around for re-rendering.

* Composite state in a $render component

Composite state is used in a component when a component has many view properties.

```js {1}
const MovingDot = (coordinates = { x:0, y:3 }) {
 // code
}
```

`or`

```js {2}
const MovingDot = (props) {
  const coordinates = props || { x:0, y:3 };
   // code
}
```

Composite state is suitable when you have to pass many properties around for re-rendering.

### State in the global scope

A global state is the current or latest data of an app that is accessible to all parts of the app. A global state can be used from anywhere in an application. 

In $render, you can use `$state()` in any component to access the state of you application. [Learn more](utils/$state()) 

### Global component context.

It is state of a component stored in the global scope but only accessible by the component and any component that subscribes to the context. 

In $render, you can use `$createContext() and $useContext()` in any component to create and access `a global component context`. [Learn more](utils/$state()) 

In short, the global component context is like the React context but with a twist.

State is created within a component or global scope and it can be passed down to children components as `props` in short for properties.
