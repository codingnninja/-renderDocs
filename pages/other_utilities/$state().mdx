# $state() utility

`$state()` is an accessor to get the state of your application anywhere in your app. It is a customizable utility to handle the global state of your applications.

  Note: $state() is only useful when you are using esModules. You don't need it in a `script` tag (functions are accessible by default). 
</Callout>

### Setup $state() utility

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Create `stateAndUtilSetup.js`

If you scaffold your application with `create-render-app`, `$state()` comes with it in `stateAndUtilSetup.js`file (In utilities folder). If you're using a `script` tag, you need to create `stateAndUtilSetup.js` file in your project and add the code from [stateAndUtilSetup.js]() to it.

### Create state with `setState` utility.

Create the state for your entire app in the root or topmost component in your project and access it with `$state()` anywhere in the project.

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['cdn', 'module']}>
  <Tabs.Tab> 
    * Add `stateAndUtilSetup.js` to the `HTML` page where you use `setState`.

    ```html copy
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>

        <!-- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codingnninja/render@0.0.0/dist/umd/bundle.min.js"></script>
      </body> -->
      <script src="stateAndUtilSetup.js"></script>
    </html>
    ```

    * Use `setState` to make your application state accessible everywhere in the project.

    ```js filename="App.js" copy
      const App = () => {

        let state = {
          songs,
          shuffle: false,
          repeat: false,
          selected: false,
          volume: 0,
          playingInterval: null,
        }

        setState(state);
      }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab> 
  <Tabs.Tab> 

    ```js filename="App.js" copy
      import {setState} from './stateAndUtilSetup'

      const App = () => {

        let state = {
          songs,
          shuffle: false,
          repeat: false,
          selected: false,
          volume: 0,
          playingInterval: null,
        }

        setState(state);
      }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab> 
</Tabs>

Now, you can use `$state()` anywhere in your project.
</Steps>

### Use $state() utility

`$state()` takes no argument and it returns state object. It is immutable and can be used in various way.

* Get state

```js copy
const state = $state()
```

`state` now contains everything in the state of your application.

* Get a property of the state

```js copy
const users = $state().users
const posts = $state().posts
```

### Reset the state

You can't reset the state with `setState`. It will throw an error. To do so, you must use `$resetState`.

* Add `stateAndUtilSetup.js` to the `HTML` page where you use `resetState`.

```js filename="Profile.js" copy
const Profile = () => {
  const updatedUserInfo = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 78
  }

  const state = $state();
  state.user = updatedUserInfo;
  resetState(state);
}
```

### Update a property of the state

```js copy
 const state = $state();
 state.update('shuffle', true);
```

In the code snippet above, we update `shuffle` (a property of the state) to true.

### Subscribe to a property of the state

You can subscribe a component, function, class or module to a property of the state so that they are notified whenever the the propery changes.

```js copy
export const Shuffle = (status=false) => {
  const state = $state();
  state.subscribe(Shuffle, "status");
  `;
}
```

Now, we have subscribed `Shuffle` to `status` (a property of the state) so that `Shuffle` will be called whenver `status` changes. 

That is how to use the `$state()` utility in $render.

  Note: 80% of time, you don't need `$state()` accessor. Instead, pass data, including function utilities, as props. When the data is needed by almost every part of the project, then you can use `$state()` accessor.
