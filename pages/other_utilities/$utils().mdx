# $utils()

`$utils()` is an accessor to reuse some utilities in multiple places in your application. It is a customizable utility to access function utilities to be used by different parts of an app.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: $utils() is only useful when you are using esModules. You don't need it in a `script` tag (functions are accessible by default). 

  Even in esModules, you only need it if you don't want to pass functions as props.
</Callout>


### Setup $utils() utility

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Create `stateAndUtilSetup.js`

If you scaffold your application with `create-render-app`, `$utils()` comes with it in `stateAndUtilSetup.js`file (In utilities folder). If you're using a `script` tag, you need to create `stateAndUtilSetup.js` file in your project and add the code from [stateAndUtilSetup.js]() to it.

### Create utilities with `setUtils`.

Create utilities for your entire app in a file and you can access them with `$utils()` anywhere in the project.

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['cdn', 'module']}>
  <Tabs.Tab> 
    * Add `stateAndUtilSetup.js` to the `HTML` page where you use `setUtils`. [Example]()

    ```html copy
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>

        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codingnninja/render@0.0.0/dist/umd/bundle.min.js"></script>
        <script src="stateAndUtilSetup.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    * Create an appUtils.js and add your utilities.

    ```js filename="appUtils.js" copy
       function toggle(status){
         Render(Shuffle, !status);
       }

       function show(element){
         element.classList.add(show);
       }

       const utils = {
         toggle,
         show
       }
    ```
    * Link your appUtils.js to the HTML page you're working with.

    * Then set your utilities with `setUtils` at the root or topmost component to be accessible anywhere in your application.
    
    ```js filename="App.js" copy
      const App = () => {
        setUtils(utils);

        //rest of the code
      }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab> 
  <Tabs.Tab> 

    ```js filename="App.js" copy
      import {setUtils} from './stateAndUtilSetup'

      const App = () => {
        setUtils(utils);

        //rest of the code
      }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab> 
</Tabs>

Now, you can use `$utils()` anywhere in your project to reuse utilities.
</Steps>

### Use $utils()

`$utils()` takes no argument and it returns an object containing utility functions. It is immutable and can be used in various way.

* Get all utilities

```js copy
const utils = $utils()
```

`utils` now contains all the utilities you setup.

* Get an utility

```js copy
const toggle = $utils().toggle
const show = $utils().show
$utils().toggle();
```

### Reset or update $utils()

Since you create your utilities, you have to reset them manually. You can always remove unuse utility functions by hand.

  Note: 80% of time, you don't need the `$utils()` accessor. Instead, pass data, including function utilities, as props. When some `utils` are needed by almost all parts of application, then you can use `$utils()`.
