# $purify utility

`$purify` converts stringified data back to its original version. In JavaScript, any object passed via template literals will turn to `[Object object]`. To avoid that from happening, `$render` introduces `stringify` to convert data to a string before passing it to template literals.

By default, `$render` uses `$purify` internally on any props passed to a component or any utilities so you don't need to do it yourself. The only time you need `$purify` is when you don't use `$render` component and internal utilities.

That means you need to `$purify` a `stringified` data passed to a function.

```js copy
 const App = () => {
  const media = {};
  return `
    <div id="main">
      <article>
        <Player />
        <Playlist />
        <Overlay />
      </article>
      <button onClick="transformMedia(stringify(${media}))">transform media</button>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

In this case, you need to use `$purify` to manually convert the argument received in `transformMedia` to its original version because it doesn't pass through $render component or internal utilities.

* When you can't use $purify

```js copy
function add(props) {
  const result = props.first + props.second;
  $render(Calculator, result);
}

function Calculator(result) {
  return `
    <div id="calc">
      ${result ? `updated to ${result}` : ""}
      <button 
        onClick="$trigger(${add}, null, {first:4, second:5})">
        add
      </button>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

You don't need to `$purify` operands passed to `add` utility as it passes through an internal utility (`$trigger`).

In short, you only use `$purify` when you `stringify` data and the data doesn't pass through `$render`.
