# $register utility

`$register` utility is only used in esModules to make components or any functions, in a module, accessible to `$render`. If you don't use `$register` in esModules, your components won't be accessible to `$render`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: You don't need to use `$register` when using `$render` in a `script` tag as components are accessible by default.
</Callout>

### $register a component

You only need to $register a component where it is imported and used (not where it is created).

```js copy
const Shuffle = (status=false) => {
  return `
    <div id="shuffle">
      <button class="btn-icon toggle">
        <span 
          class="material-symbols-rounded ${status ? 'active': ''}"
          onclick="$render(Shuffle, ${!status})"
        >shuffle ${status} </span>
      </button>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

`Shuffle` is created. Now, let use it in `App` component.

```js copy
  import {Shuffle} from './Shuffle'

  const App = () => {
    const media = {};
    return `
      <div id="main">
        <article>
          <Shuffle />
        </article>
        <button 
          onClick="transformMedia(${stringify(media)})">
          transform media
        </button>
      </div>
    `;
  }

$register(Shuffle);
```

You see! We `$register` Shuffle in the `App` component where it is used. You have to `$register` a component where you use it.

  Note: Once you `$register` a component, you don't need to re-register it if you have to use it in another component.
</Callout>

### $register a function

Functions and variables from a module are not accessible to DOM events like `onclick` by default. You can make them accessible by using `$register` on them.

```js filename="appFunctions.js" copy
  import {htmx} from './hypermedia'

  const $view = htmx.view;
  $register($view);
```
