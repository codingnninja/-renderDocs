# $select utility

$select is a unified utility to access the DOM. It accesses single and multiple elements accessible with JavaScript. $select returns an `array` of found elements but returns `undefined` for any element not found. It supports all `CSS selectors`.

It's like `import` for DOM.

### Select single element

```js copy
const audio = $select('#audio');
console.log(audio);
```

### Select grouped elements

Elements selected with `class`, `tag` and other group `selectors` are grouped into an array.

```js copy
const posts = $select('.post');
posts.map(post => console.log(post));
```

### Select multiple elements

Select multiple elements including single and grouped elements.

```js copy
const [audio, posts, comments] = $select('#audio, .post, .comment');

console.log(audio);

posts.map(post => console.log(post));

comments.map(comment => console.log(comment));
```

### A more complex selection

```js copy
const [
    posts,
    comments,
    audios,
    features
    articles,
    navs
] = $select('posts, comments, .audios, #features>.feature, [article], .nav');
```

### Handling variable re-assignment with $select

It is recommended to use `$select` with `const` until you need to re-assign a variable. Then, you can select such a variable separately using `$select` and `let`.

```js copy
const [audio, posts, comments] = $select('#audio, .post, .comment');
```

So when we need to re-assign the `audio` element, we can re-write the code snippet.

```js copy
let audio = $select('#audio');
const [posts, comments] = $select('.post, .comment');
```

Going with `const` and `$select` by default helps to avoid unnecessary bugs.

`$select` is a unified utility to access the DOM.
